Scrypted can create a `Smart Motion Sensor` to report when a object is detected on a camera. This feature can be used with supported cameras that report smart detection events or [Scrypted NVR Object Detection](/scrypted-nvr/).

1. Install the `Video Analysis Plugin`.
2. Click `Add New`.
3. Select a camera to create a sensor.
4. Select the desired detections to report.
5. This sensor can be synced to other platforms to be used within automations.
