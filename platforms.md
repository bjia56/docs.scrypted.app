# What are Plugins?

`Plugins` are how Scrypted imports and exports camera streams. Camera Plugins include `ONVIF`, `Hikvision`, `Amcrest`, `Ring`, and more.

`Platforms` are external home automation services that support cameras but may not support *your* camera. `Platform Plugins` can be installed in Scrypted to function as a bridge to those services.

`Platforms` include [Homekit](/homekit), [Google Home](/google-home), [Alexa](/alexa), and [Home Assistant](/home-assistant).
