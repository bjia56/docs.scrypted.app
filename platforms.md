# What is a Platform?

Platforms are external home automation services that support cameras but may not support *your* camera. Scrypted will function as a bridge to those platforms.

Platforms include [Homekit](/homekit), [Google Home](/google-home), [Alexa](/alexa), and [Home Assistant](/home-assistant).
