# What are Plugins?

`Plugins` are how Scrypted imports and exports camera streams. Camera Plugins include `ONVIF`, `Hikvision`, `Amcrest`, `Ring`, and more.

`Platforms` are external home automation services that support cameras but may not support *your* camera. Scrypted's `Platform Plugins` function as a bridge to those services.

`Platforms` include [Homekit](/homekit), [Google Home](/google-home), [Alexa](/alexa), and [Home Assistant](/home-assistant).

## Scripts

Similar to `Plugins`, `Scripts` are a lightweight user editable way to add powerful automations, devices, and features to Scrypted. Visit the [Scripts](https://scripts.scrypted.app) site for popular user contributed tools.
